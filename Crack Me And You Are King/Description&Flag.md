### Description: 
Sometimes.... keeping things the way they are, is a nice approach to a problem. Anyways..... a guy with the code name ROX@1, has been studying 'image processing' for quite a while now. He was entrusted with a secret code once and he hid the code within the image. Later on, he found out that the solution script which he wrote, has been corrupted and he can't find the secret code without it. Can you help him find out that secret code??
